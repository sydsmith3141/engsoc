											<h3> Women in Engineering</h3>

										</header>
										</a>
										<p>
The goal of the Women in Engineering (WiE) Society is to build a welcoming community of engineering students at Ontario Tech in order to help them feel a greater sense of belonging and lead them towards empowerment. To do this, WiE holds both social events which bring students together, as well as events for professional development to help them gain the skills necessary to stand out and succeed in the field of engineering, where women are still a minority. Students can get involved by participating in events and signing up to volunteer for booths and workshops.
