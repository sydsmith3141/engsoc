	<h3>GEARS Orientation</h3>
</br>
<p>
	To introduce new engineering students to the campus, the GEARS Community organizes an orientation in which provides a full day of activities including bubble soccer, dodgeball, volleyball, student panel and many more entertaining events. Students living in Simcoe Village and South Village are encouraged to join the full day of events before the school year starts.

	<h3>Car Smash</h3>
</br>
<p>
	The car smash started as a frosh event back in 2017. This event was aimed as an engaging mental health approach for our incoming first year students. We had markers that students will use to write their fears, insecurities, and doubts on the vehicles for later to proceed to “smash them away”. This creates a fun interaction while easing the nervousness that this High School to University transition might have. For students that might not want to participate in the Car Smash we provided a car show as well with music and popcorn.
	Since then, the car smash has become an annual event hosted by EngSoc in frosh week in September.

	<h3>Patch Scavenger Hunt</h3>
</br>
<p>
	The Engineering Society manages a variety of merchandise in which a part of it are patches. Patches are a nationwide engineering student tradition in which we take part of. At our Scavenger Hunts we will be featuring other school’s patches from time to time, but mainly our patches for students to seek.

<div class="col-8 top-buffer col-12-mobile special">
	<h3>Reverse Career Fair</h3>
</br>
<p>
	The reverse career fair is a unique event for the engineering students at Ontario Tech University.This event takes all conventional job fairs and switch it around to address that issue and create more opportunities for student-employer interaction for our membership.
</br>
The way the reverse career fair works is that instead of employers setting tables for students to approach them, it is the other way around. What does this mean you ask? This means that we fill the gym with tables for students to showcase their projects and themselves while numerous employers approach them directly.

	<h3>4D Movie</h3>

<p>
	The 4D movie allows the total immersion of the classic movie twister. While attending the movie students will be given a poncho as just like in the movie it might be getting a little wet. Using the wind tunnel we can crank up the speed of the wind and rain to make it seem like your really in a twister!
