									<h3>What is ESSCO and CFES?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The Ontario Tech Engineering Students’ Society is affiliated and is a member of numerous organizations provincially as well as nationally. OT EngSoc is member of the Engineering Student Societies' Council of Ontario (<a href=http://www.essco.ca>ESSCO</a>), and the Canadian Federation of Engineering Students (<a href=http://cfes.ca>CFES</a>).

									ESSCO is a student organization at the provincial level and CFES is a student organization at the national level. They both provide countless involvement opportunities, for more information email external.engsoc@ontariotechu.ca

									Thanks to our membership with CFES we get the ability apply to engineering courses in europe hosted by an affiliated organization called the Board of European Students of Technology (BEST). To learn more of the BEST courses click <a href=https://cfes.ca/best-courses> here</a>.

							<p> In addition to the core conferences found below, there are also Engineering Competitions, Six Sigma Courses, and many others. If none of these appeal to you; the Ontario Tech EngSoc also offers funding 
for other conferences if they meet certain criteria. Contact the <a href="Executives.html">Vice President External</a> for more information.
							<br/><br/><br/><br/>
							<h4>ESSCO AGM </h4> 
							<p>ESSCO’s Annual General Meeting (AGM) is the first conference after most schools’ new VPXs take office, and largely serves as a VPX training weekend where you learn the ins and outs of ESSCO and CFES. In addition to the VPX Stream, there is also a general leadership/professional development stream geared towards training other Engsoc executives how to better serve their student bodies. At this conference ESSCO also holds their executive elections, and every school present will have the opportunity to vote on who they will work with over the next year.
							<br/><b>Stay tuned for AGM 2021 info</b> 
 							</p><br/>

							<h4>ESSCO PM</h4> 
							<p>ESSCO President’s Meeting is the first conference of the academic year, typically the first-second week of September. The purpose of this conference is to give the VPXs an update on what ESSCO has been up to since AGM, and also to get the VPXs inputs on what initiatives ESSCO should work on over the next year.
							<br/><b>Stay tuned for PM 2021 info</b> 
 							</p><br/>

 							<h4>ESSCO FYIC</h4> 
							<p>ESSCO’s First Year Integration Conference is many engineering students’ entry to leadership. This conference aims to teach first year students about how and why they should get involved in their Engsoc, as well as ESSCO and CFES.
 							<br/><b>Stay tuned for FYIC 2021 info</b> 
 							</p><br/>

							<h4>ESSCO PEO-SC</h4> 
							<p>The PEO Student Conference is focused on explaining the engineering licensure process, as well as showcasing the benefits of becoming an EIT upon graduation. This conference is largely meant for upper year students getting close to graduation.<br/>
							<b>Next Hosting</b><i> Fri, Sep 25 - Sun, Sep 27, 2020 by the University of Windsor</i> 
 							</p><br/>

							<h4>CFES CDE </h4> 
							<p>The Conference on Diversity in Engineering was originally meant to be about increasing the number of women in the engineering profession, but has since morphed into a conference about general inclusivity (gender, race, handicapped, LGBTQ, etc).
							<br/><b>Stay tuned for CDE 2021 info</b>
 							</p><br/>

							<h4>CFES Congress </h4> 
							<p>Congress is the largest and most important conference of the year. Congress is CFES’s equivalent to ESSCO’s AGM. At Congress delegates are divided into 4 streams, Professional Development, Engsoc, Leadership, and VPX. In the VPX stream, delegates will go through a series of talks about what CFES has done since CFES PM, and what they intend to do with the remainder of the year. CFES also will have their elections for their new executives/councilors.

 							</p><br/>

							<h4>CFES CSE </h4> 
							<p>New to CFES is the Conference on Sustainable Engineering. This conference covers how engineers can promote their own business and products to be more sustainable towards the environment.
