										As a society, Ontario Tech’s Engineering Students’ Society values assisting our engineering students in reaching their individual goals and aims to provide services that accurately
represent student needs. In addition to offering academic advocacy, supporting and funding a variety of other clubs and sub-societies, supporting the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the school’s Student Union, as a society we also have a mental
health initiative called ‘SAFE’ in place for our students.

											<h3>SAFE</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
										Student Assistance for Emotional Wellness (SAFE) is a student organization that focuses on providing a student assistance network for students who may be suffering from
mental instability
or mental health problems. At Ontario Tech, approximately 1,600 students will experience mental instability during the 2018-2019 school year. What makes SAMI unique is the proactive approach to address students’ mental health and well-being. If you would like to
learn more about Ontario Tech EngSoc's flagship service; formed due to the Executive's recognition that mental health of post-secondary students is in a crisis mode all across North America, click <a href="SAFE.html">here</a>
