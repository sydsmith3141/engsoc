								<h2>Students' Assistance for Emotional Wellness</h2>

							<p>
								With the collaboration of existing mental health and wellness services, SAFE is working to provide free Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training for post-secondary students. The Mental Health
Commission of Canada's MHFA training will not only empower students, it will also cultivate a culture of recognition and support for those who experiences instances of mental instability.
							</p>
							<p>

							<b>WHAT IS MENTAL INSTABILITY?</b>
							<ul>
							<li>substance related disorders,</li>
    						<li>mood related disorders,</li>
    						<li>anxiety and Trauma related disorders,</li>
   							<li>psychotic disorders,</li>
   							<li>and others.</li>
   							</ul>
   						</p>
<p>
Mental instabilities can affect anyone, at any point in time. From stress and anxiety to bipolar disorders and depression, nobody is immune. These factors can negatively impact your academics, relationships, mood, as well as your overall quality of life. Mental instabilities will become overwhelming to deal with alone.
</p><p>
Most mental health initiatives are focused on providing psychiatric assistance for those seeking help. However, the Mental Health Commission of Canada found that more than 60% of individuals with mental health problems and mental illnesses won’t seek the help that they need. It is for this reason that the Carter Center Mental Health Program considers reducing the stigma around mental health problems as a primary key to improving mental well-being.
</p><p>
The SAFE initiative takes a unique approach by facilitating better communication and connection between existing mental health services and students who may be suffering from mental instability. This is accomplished by fostering and maintaining a network of
student peers that are trained with Mental Health First Aid.
SAMI uses a visual identifier to be displayed on trained student’s backpacks, computers, notebooks, clothing, and accessories. This symbol indicates that these individuals are safe, confidential, and capable of helping or finding help for those in need.
</p><p>
How SAFE's initiative will work is that students will be given the opportunity to register and receive training for:
<ul>
    <li>Substance overdose,</li>
    <li>Suicidal behavior,</li>
    <li>Panic attacks,</li>
    <li>Acute stress reaction,</li>
    <li>Psychotic episodes</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Trainees will learn how to safely use the five basic actions (ALGEE) that define the framework for having a safe and effective conversation about mental health. That is:
<ul>
    <li>Assess the risk of harm and/or suicide,</li>
    <li>Listen non-judgmentally,</li>
    <li>Give reassurance,</li>
    <li>Encourage professional support,</li>
    <li>Encourage other supports,</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
<p><b>THE COST OF SAFE</b></br>
Currently it takes $5,428.50 to hold a training session for 30 students.</br>
The training cost per person is $180.95 however the cost of someone's well-being is priceless.</br>
</br>
Our yearly funding goal: $37,999.50</br>
5 year goal for Ontario Tech: maintain 5% of enrolled students trained (~400) for fall and winter</br>
